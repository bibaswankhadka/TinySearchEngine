# TinySearchEngine

!!!!Important!!!!!

To prevent the crawler from crawling a website and overloading it's resources, the program is coded to only crawl URLs beginning with https://thayer.github.io/engs50/ .
If for any reason you want to crawl a different website go to utils/webpage.h and replace the URL found in the method 
bool IsInternalURL(char *url. This method is the last method in the header file.
